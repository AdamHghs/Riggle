# Riggle

Riggle is a lightweight Rust application that prevents your computer from going idle by simulating periodic mouse movements. The application runs as a tray icon in your system tray and provides an easy-to-use menu to start and stop the mouse jiggle functionality.

## Features

- **System Tray Integration**: Runs discreetly in the system tray, with options to start, stop, and exit.
- **Custom Mouse Jiggle**: Moves the mouse periodically to prevent screensavers, auto-locks, or sleep modes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, ideal for keeping your system awake without unnecessary overhead.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Double-click the executable or run it from the terminal.
2. **System Tray Menu**:
   - **Start Jiggle**: Starts periodic mouse movement.
   - **Stop Jiggle**: Stops the jiggle function.
   - **Quit**: Exits the application.
